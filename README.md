In the first version of this network, latency was tracked when sending trading information between two docker containers running Ubuntu. The 1st Docker container (Exchange) sends information into a network over UDP. Another docker container (the trader) then reads this information and sends it to a MongoDB database. The frontend is built with NextJS, using TypeScript. A Rest API was built in NextJS to query the MongoDB database repeatedly, in order to load data about latency.

Version two of this tool was revised to connect with an AWS EC2 Instance while containing the same features as version 1. Version 2 employs a MongoDB status flag in order to determine the status of the system (normal/recording). On the EC2 instance, we have two services running: 1 for the monitoring of the database status flag, and another (which gets started by the aforementioned process) that receives the UDP packets from the exchange docker, and "records" them into a text file. Monit is also employed to monitor whether or not this "trade logging" function is running or not. Furthermore, if the EC2 status listener process detects the system switched back to normal mode, it will stop the logging service.
